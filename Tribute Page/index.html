                to boxing coach Fred Stoner. That started the journey of Cassius Clay turning into Muhammad Ali the
                legend. He won ten titles from then to the Rome Olympics in 1960.<br><br>

          Muhammad Ali was a man of many talents. He was a world-renowned
          boxer, a gifted poet, and a passionate advocate for social justice.
          But above all else, he was an inspiration to millions of people
          around the world. Muhammad Ali was a heavyweight champion boxer who
          is widely considered to be one of the greatest athletes of all time.
          He was known for his flamboyant personality, his quick wit, and his
          refusal to back down from a fight, both inside and outside of the
          ring.
          <br>
          <br>
          Ali was born Cassius Marcellus Clay Jr. in Louisville, Kentucky, in
          1942. His father, Cassius Marcellus Clay, Sr., supported a wife and
          two sons by painting billboards and signs. His mother, Odessa Grady
          Clay, worked as a household domestic. He began boxing as an amateur
          at the age of 12 and won the gold medal at the 1960 Summer Olympics.
          He turned professional the following year and quickly rose through
          the ranks, winning his first world heavyweight title in 1964 by
          defeating Sonny Liston. Ali was the first fighter to win the world
          heavyweight championship on three separate occasions; he
          successfully defended this title 19 times.

          Ali was a flamboyant and charismatic figure who captured the
          attention of the public. He was also a gifted poet and orator who
          used his platform to speak out against injustice and oppression. In
          1967, he refused to serve in the Vietnam War, citing religious
          objections. This decision cost him his boxing title and led to a
          three-year exile from the sport.
          <br>
          <br>
          Despite the controversy, Ali remained one of the most popular
          athletes in the world. He was a charismatic and quotable figure who
          was able to connect with people from all walks of life. He continued
          to speak out against injustice and discrimination, and he used his
          fame to promote causes such as civil rights and racial equality. In
          1999, he was named "Sportsman of the Century" by Sports Illustrated.

          Muhammad Ali was a member of the inaugural class of the
          International Boxing Hall of Fame in 1990, and in 2005 he was
          awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom. Muhammad Ali achieved
          renown as a boxer through his speed, superb footwork, ability to
          take a punch, and tremendous courage. His final record of 56 wins
          and 5 losses with 37 knockouts has been matched by others, but the
          quality of his opponents and his overwhelming success during his
          prime placed him among boxing's immortals. Ali retired from boxing
          in 1981 after a long and illustrious career. He was diagnosed with
          Parkinson's disease in the 1980s, but he continued to be a public
          figure and advocate for peace and understanding until his death in
          2016.
          <br>
          <br>
          Muhammad Ali was a true champion, both in and out of the ring. He
          was a fearless fighter who never backed down from a challenge. He
          was also a kind and compassionate man who used his platform to help
          others. He was a great boxer, a larger-than-life personality, and a
          force for good in the world. Ali's legacy will live on for
          generations to come, and he will be remembered as one of the most
          inspirational figures of the 20th century.

                as past their peak. Ali and Shavers fought ferociously enough
                to pick off separate rounds, yet in the 15th Ali did enough to
                secure a unanimous decision.<br><br>

                Ali had expected an easy fight against Spinks but was
                surprisingly outmanoeuvred by his opponent who won on points.
                It was only Spinks's eighth professional fight, and it was the
                fastest rise of a boxer to become world heavyweight champion
                in the sport's history.<br><br>

                Ali exacted swift revenge on Spinks to regain the title. Ali
                was always in control at the Superdome in New Orleans, where
                the 63,350 was the largest indoor attendance for a boxing
                match, and won a unanimous decision to become the first boxer
                to win the world title three times.<br><br>

                After a short-lived retirement Ali found himself back in the
                ring against the new world champion. It was a heartbreaking
                encounter. Holmes battered the 38-year-old Ali and he lost the
                match by knock out in the 11th round.<br><br>

                anticlimax against Berbick. After seven quite even rounds,
                Berbick dominated the last three and ran out the winner on a
